### Overview 
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Reddit Sentiment Tracker: Canadian Politics Edition project. This end-to-end Sentiment Analysis project focuses on Canadian politics, analyzing sentiment from Reddit posts related to the Trudeau and Poilievre governments.

### Key Features
Live Data Fetching: The project is designed to fetch live data, ensuring that sentiment analysis is continually updated to reflect the most recent opinions on Reddit.

ETL Process: Leveraging ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) principles, the project seamlessly extracts data from Reddit, transforms it using the NLTK library for sentiment analysis, and loads it into AWS Athena for further analysis.

PowerBI Dashboard: A comprehensive PowerBI dashboard provides real-time insights into public sentiment towards Canadian political figures. The dashboard includes KPIs, extreme sentiments, and comparisons between Trudeau and Poilievre.
